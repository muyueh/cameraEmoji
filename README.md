# Camera Emoji

Camera Emoji shows a live webcam preview and uses face-api.js to detect facial expressions, mapping them to an emoji and label in real time.

## Live demo

When published with GitHub Pages the site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/cameraEmoji/`.

## Development

1. Serve the project locally with any static file server (for example, `npx serve .`).
2. Open the page in your browser.
3. Grant the tab permission to use your webcam when prompted.
4. Hold your face within the frame so the model can identify expressions.
5. Use the Start/Stop buttons if you need to reset the stream.

If your browser blocks the webcam, check its site permissions and try again. A stable internet connection is required for the model weights to download the first time you load the page.
