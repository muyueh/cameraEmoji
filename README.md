# Camera Emoji

A lightweight GitHub Pages experience that pairs your live webcam expression with the emoji that best matches it. Powered by [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js).

## Live demo

Once published with GitHub Pages the site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/cameraEmoji/`.

## Development

1. Serve the project locally (any static file server works, e.g. `npx serve .`).
2. Open the page in your browser and allow webcam access.
3. Try different expressions and watch the emoji update in real-time.

## Facial expressions reference

The app highlights seven expressions detected by the model, and the page lists ten common expressions with representative emojis:
