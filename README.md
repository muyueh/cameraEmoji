# Camera Emoji

This version of Camera Emoji focuses exclusively on the foundation: getting a reliable webcam preview running in the browser. Once the live feed is stable we can iterate on face analysis and emoji mapping.

## Live demo

When published with GitHub Pages the site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/cameraEmoji/`.

## Development

1. Serve the project locally with any static file server (for example, `npx serve .`).
2. Open the page in your browser.
3. Grant the tab permission to use your webcam when prompted.
4. Use the Start/Stop buttons to control the stream and confirm the preview works.

If your browser blocks the webcam, check its site permissions and try again.
